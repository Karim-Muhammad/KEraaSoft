CRUD Operations is a set of operations that are used to create, read, update and delete data.

CRUD is an acronym that comes from the world of `computer programming` and refers to the **four functions** that are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application: `create`, `read`, `update` and `delete`. Persistent storage refers to any data storage device that retains power after the device is powered off, such as a hard disk or a solid-state drive. In contrast, random access memory and internal caching are two examples of volatile memory - they contain data that will be erased when they lose power.
