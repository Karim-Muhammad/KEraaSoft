# Functional Programming

> it is approach we can use to build software by concept, "tell me what you want, not how to do it"
> and this approach came in picture for calculation problems that need to be solved by mathematical functions.
> Function Programming also can be considered as `Declarative Programming`

# Procedural Programming

> it is approach we can use to build a softwrae by concept, "Tell me how to do it, not just what you want", every step you need to do is written in code.
> Procedural Programming also can be considered as `Imperative Programming`
> Procedural Programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.

# Object Oriented Programming

> it is approach we can use to build a software by concept, "Every thing is Entity, and every entity has properties and methods"
> Object Oriented Programming also can be considered as `Imperative Programming` and `Declarative Programming` because you write code by yourself, and you build a abstraction layer for your code.
> OOP helps us to build Architecture for our code, and it is very useful for big projects.
